# ReverseAndNot

Write a function that takes an integer i and returns a string with the integer backwards followed by the original integer.

To illustrate:

"123"

We reverse "123" to get "321" and then add "123" to the end, resulting in "321123".

Examples

ReverseAndNot(123) ➞ "321123"

ReverseAndNot(152) ➞ "251152"

ReverseAndNot(123456789) ➞ "987654321123456789"

Notes

i is a non-negative integer.
Bonus: By using System.Linq this should be completed in one line of code.
